**Classes and Objects**

```aidl

It is a blueprint for clearing Objects

An Object is an instance of a Class.


Attributes/
Behaviour/Methods

Classes are maned with the PascalNamingConvention.

Key Concept to Understand when it comes to classes.

TextBox Class.

(Attributes)
(Text,Limit,Length,isFocused)

(Methods)
(setText(),clear(),enable(),disable())

```


**Memory Management**

```aidl

Java manages our memory in 2 different locations:


1.Heap - Objects.

2.Stack - Primitives and Short lived variables.


```
**KeyWords**

```aidl

static--->it is used when we are calling a method from the main
method.
```
**Encapsulation**

```aidl

Bundle the data and methods that operate on the data inside a single unit/object.

```

**Getters and Setters**

```aidl

They are used for vaildation.

There may be datarisks when i allow seeting of class fields/attributes
directly.

setters and getters are the functions i use to access the class fields.

They come in when i do not want to access my class attributes directly.

In Java we should make our fields private(i.e accessible only to the class
then have getters and setters)

```
**Abstraction**
```
It means that we should reduce complexity by hiding unecessary details in
our classes.

```
**Coupling**

```aidl

It is the level of dependency between classes.

The more our classes are coupled to each other, the more costly
our changes are going to be.

By reducing coupling we can reduce the impact of changes

We should hide the uncessarry details from the class as much
as possible especially for util methods than can be used internally.

We should declare those as private.


Because private methods are used internally within the class the other
methods are not affected.

We should strictly adhere to using the methods than can be used
internally to stictly internally.

OOP is a way of thinking,it is a way of building software.
