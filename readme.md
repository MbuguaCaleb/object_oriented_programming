It is a blueprint for clearing Objects

An Object is an instance of a Class.

Key Concept to Understand when it comes to classes.

```


**Memory Management**

```aidl

Java manages our memory in 2 different locations:


1.Heap - Objects.

2.Stack - Primitives and Short lived variables.


```
**KeyWords**

```aidl

static--->it is used when we are calling a method from the main
method.
```
**Encapsulation**

```aidl

Bundle the data and methods that operate on the data inside a single unit/object.

```

**Getters and Setters**

```aidl

They are used for vaildation.

There may be datarisks when i allow seeting of class fields/attributes
directly.

setters and getters are the functions i use to access the class fields.

They come in when i do not want to access my class attributes directly.

In Java we should make our fields private(i.e accessible only to the class
then have getters and setters)
